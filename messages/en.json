      },
      {
        "question": "Should oval faces have bangs?",
        "answer": "Yes! Oval faces can rock most bang styles, from curtain bangs to side-swept or even blunt bangs. Just avoid very heavy, straight-across bangs that cover too much of your forehead, as this can throw off your balanced proportions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What hairstyles should oval faces avoid?",
        "answer": "While oval faces are very versatile, you should avoid styles that add too much volume on the sides, which can make your face look rounder. Also, avoid covering your forehead entirely, as this is one of your best features."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is a bob haircut good for oval face?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Bobs are excellent for oval faces. Whether it's a classic chin-length bob, a longer lob, or an asymmetrical bob, this cut complements oval face shapes beautifully."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the most attractive face shape?",
        "answer": "While beauty is subjective, the oval face shape is often considered the 'ideal' face shape due to its balanced proportions. However, every face shape has its own unique beauty and flattering hairstyles."

    ],
    "round": [
      {
        "question": "What is the best haircut for a round face?",
        "answer": "The best haircuts for round faces add height and angles. Long layers, side-swept bangs, and asymmetrical cuts work well. Avoid chin-length bobs that add width."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should round faces have bangs?",
        "answer": "Side-swept or curtain bangs work great for round faces as they create angles. Avoid blunt, straight-across bangs that emphasize the roundness."
      },
      {
        "question": "What hairstyles make a round face look thinner?",
        "answer": "Styles with volume at the crown, long layers, and side parts help elongate round faces. Avoid center parts and styles that add width at the cheeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is short hair good for round faces?",

      {
        "question": "How can I make my round face look more oval?",

      {
        "question": "Should square faces avoid bangs?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What haircuts should square faces avoid?",

      {
        "question": "How do I soften my square jawline with hair?",

      {
        "question": "Is a pixie cut good for heart-shaped faces?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How can I balance my heart-shaped face?",

        "question": "What is the best haircut for a diamond face?",
        "answer": "Chin-length bobs, side-swept bangs, and styles with fullness at the forehead and chin work best. These balance the wide cheekbones."

        "question": "Should diamond faces have bangs?",
        "answer": "Yes! Side-swept bangs add width to the narrow forehead. Avoid very short bangs that expose too much of the forehead."

        "question": "What hairstyles should diamond faces avoid?",
        "answer": "Avoid slicked-back styles, very short hair, and styles that add volume at the cheekbones. These emphasize the widest part of the face."

      {
        "question": "Is a bob good for diamond faces?",
        "answer": "Yes! Chin-length bobs are excellent for diamond faces as they add fullness at the narrow chin while balancing the cheekbones."

      {
        "question": "How can I balance my diamond face shape?",
        "answer": "Add volume at the forehead with bangs and at the chin with layers. Keep hair smooth over the cheekbones to minimize their width."
